	<br />
	<br />

	<p>
		The codling moth overwinters as a mature larva 
		in a silk cocoon. In early spring, the overwintering 
		larvae begin pupation, progress to the adult growth 
		stage, mate, and lay eggs which hatch into larvae. 
		In orchards, the larvae find and burrow into the 
		fruit, usually within approximately one day after 
		hatching. The larvae grow and mature in the fruit, 
		coming out to build their cocoon and overwinter or 
		pupate. And the cycle begins again. Each cycle is 
		called a generation of the pest. In Washington state, 
		we typically experience two full generations, and in 
		some warm years a partial third generation of the codling moth.

	<p>
		Within each generation, a certain proportion of 
		larvae pupate and start the next generation cycle. 
		The rest go into a state of delayed development and 
		inactivity (diapause induction). If these diapause-induced 
		larvae reach full growth, they will overwinter successfully. 
		Sometimes, the last generation diapause-induced larvae 
		do not receive enough growing degree day accumulation 
		to grow enough to successfully overwinter.
		<br />
		The fraction of larvae that are diapause-induced 
		versus those that pupate is a function of the 
		photoperiod or day length. When the days are shorter, 
		a larger fraction of the larvae are diapause-induced 
		for overwintering and a smaller fraction pupate into 
		the next generation. When the days are longer, a smaller 
		fraction is diapause-induced for overwintering, and a 
		larger fraction pupates into the next generation.
